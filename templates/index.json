Now, with this revolutionary, convenient, scent delivery system, you can improve your brain function in ways that aromatherapy, supplements, drugs, or computer games can’t come close to. Memory Air® is the perfect self-care for your brain."

Named one of the top 2% of scientists in the world, Dr. Leon discovered that when the olfactory system is stimulated in a very specific way, your brain function and memory are improved. To get these brain benefits, a variety of scents must be delivered consistently every day. So Dr. Leon developed Memory Air®, a device that does the whole process for you automatically, while you sleep!"

On your first night with Memory Air®, you simply push the Start button one time when you go to bed, and then you’re done! \n\nThe Start button does not need to be pushed every night.  Memory Air® will remember when you go to bed and do everything automatically.\n\nThen when your monthly replacement Scent Belt arrives at your home, just remove the old belt and replace it with the new one. You do not have to push the Start button again"

If you sleep on your left side, you should place your device on the right side of the bed.  If you predominantly sleep on your back, either side will do."
