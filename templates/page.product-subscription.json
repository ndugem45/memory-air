Where I used to search the Internet for information partially remembered, I can now most often retrieve the information myself. I no longer have to write down phone numbers or pin codes as I am completely confident I will remember them.<br/><br/>I am also amazed at the ease with which I can retrieve names and events occurring scores of years ago. Also, my sleep has improved markedly. The difference before and after the regimen of olfactory enhancement on my memory, cognition and sleep is astonishing.<br/><br/>Importantly, the process is completely passive and requires no ingestion of medication nor possible side effects. Bottom line, the upside of this process is staggering, and there is practically no downside.\"</p>"
