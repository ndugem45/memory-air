What I noticed while I have the device active is that I sleep deeper and better. I find myself being the one to remember names and details more often than before I used it. Words seem to come more easily now. When I had the break between devices my sleep was not as sound and the memory benefits seemed to hold.  These are subtle but noticeable changes that are making a positive difference on a daily basis."
